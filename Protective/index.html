            <h1>On July 8, Malaysian comedian Nigel Ng uploaded to YouTube a video titled "DISGUSTED by this Egg
                Fried Rice Video" under his comedic persona "Uncle Roger." What Ng intended to be a comedic video
                sparked
                a firestorm of dismay and disbelief as it ricocheted
                around the internet.</h1>

                <span>ðŸ’¬10M in 1 month. This woman really triggered a lot of Asian people. Edit: and people around the
                    world who also likes to eat rice.</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬Asians normally: *chillin' by themselves*, BBC woman: *cooks rice wrong*, Asians:
                    *UNITED*</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬I cringed so hard when she scraped the non-stick pan with a metal spoon. I swear I heard my mom
                    screaming from 50 miles away</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬Some Asian countries hate each other, but we agree that the woman's egg fried rice is a big
                    disappointment.</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬This is what I don't like about European / American people when making Asian food, they feel
                    pretentious by how to cook it even though there are still many mistakes in making it. Haiyahhh....
                    Hey uncle roger Ive been using a measuring cup and a sauce pot on an induction stove forever and my
                    rice always comes out PERFECT!!! Lmaooo ew msg</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬SHE USE COLENDER AND SAUCE PAN SAUCE PAN??? so dissapointed</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬Her eyes look so sad, like someone is pointing a gun at her from behind the camera and forcing
                    her to do the video</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬As an asian, this video made me understand why italians die after watching carbonara
                    videos</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬Those 11K dislikes are from people who drain their rice with colander.</span>

            <h1>The controversy over the BBC Food clip, and the reaction it provoked within certain Asian communities,
                speaks to a broader, long-standing debate about the intersection of food, ethnicity and culture -- the
                fundamental question of who is allowed to cook what food.</h1>
