            <h1>On July 8, Malaysian comedian Nigel Ng uploaded to YouTube a video titled "DISGUSTED by this Egg
                Fried Rice Video" under his comedic persona "Uncle Roger." What Ng intended to be a comedic video
                sparked a firestorm of dismay and disbelief as it ricocheted around the internet. Also raise the
                question - How <b>food</b> connects <b>identity</b> and culture?</h1>

                    pretentious by how to cook it even though there are still many mistakes in making it. Haiyahhh....
                    Hey uncle roger Ive been using a measuring cup and a sauce pot on an induction stove forever and my

                <span>ðŸ’¬Her eyes look so sad, like someone is pointing a gun at her from behind the camera and forcing
                    her to do the video</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬As an asian, this video made me understand why italians die after watching carbonara
                    videos</span>
                <span>ðŸ’¬Those 11K dislikes are from people who drain their rice with colander.</span>
